# github.com/xiam/resp

[RESP][1] encoder/decoder.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/xiam/resp
```

## Usage

### Encoding

```
func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error)
    Marshal returns the RESP encoding of v. At this moment, it only works
    with string, int, []byte, nil and []interface{} types.
```

Example:

```
buf, err = resp.Marshal("Foo")
// -> $3\r\nFoo\r\n
```

### Decoding

```
func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error
    Unmarshal parses the RESP-encoded data and stores the result in the
    value pointed to by v. At this moment, it only works with string, int,
    []byte and []interface{} types.
```

Example:

```
var dest string
err = resp.Unmarshal([]byte("$3\r\nFoo\r\n"), &dest)
// -> "Foo"
```
